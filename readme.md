# Calendar

I just create a calendar for me to easier to share with other people.
You can also modify the calendar src to your gmail address if you have a public calendar.
eg. https://dotku.github.io/calendar/?src=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE

For advance features, eg public booking, you can checkout https://calendly.com.

## Todo
- Need update calendlyURL according to the URL paramter.
